# vue

Created by running `npx -p @vue/cli@5.0.4 vue create .`. Uses Vue just to use TypeScript all the way, so it's not all that reactive.

```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
